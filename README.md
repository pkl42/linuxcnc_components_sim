# Components for simulating hardware

If you want to test your linuxcnc configuration without  
having or compromising the hardware and without changing  
the .ini and .hal files, i started writing some conponents which 
simulates the real hardware.  

Currently these are e.g. mesacard 7i76e, touch probe, fork light barrier.
