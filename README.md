# Components for simulating hardware

If you want to test your linuxcnc configuration without having the hardware and  
without changing the .ini and .hal files, i started writing some conponents which 
simulates the real hardward. Current these are e.g. mesacard 7i76e, touch probe, fork light barrier.
